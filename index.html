    My name is Christina Constabile. Currently residing in Los Angeles, I am originally from a small town in Central New York. I graduated from Canisius College in Buffalo New York. In three and a half years, I received a Bachelors of Science degree in Digital Media Arts and a Bachelors of the Arts in Communication Studies. I have taken graduate classes in International Business at the Brandeis International Business school in Waltham, Massachusetts. And am currently enrolled in a certificate program at UCLA for Software Development. I've dabbled a bit in graphic and print design as well as advertising and public relations. My passions lie in photography and 3D animation. I am currently looking to further my career in something I'm passionate about that allows me to create. I am a travel photographer by hobby and hope to travel the world extensively some day. I have participated in two photography workshops. One workshop has taken me to Italy and another to Poland and Tunisia. I've also enjoyed traveling to France, Greece and England. This page serves the purpose of highlighting some of my work. In my spare time I blog, paint customized wine glasses or am exploring Los Angeles. With that being said - Please feel free to take a look around.
